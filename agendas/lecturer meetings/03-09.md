From Moodle:

> You must name your GitHub repository as follows: Team xx - Name of the project.
> It is your responsibility to provide access to this repository to all the lecturers so that they are able to verify what is done each week. Computing codes for all numerical and graphical results will be made available and can be part of the assessment for this task.
